# Note App
Project 2 with General Assembly

## :page_with_curl: About

In this project, I am building a CRUD application in form of a note-taking app.

Users can sign up to keep all their notes in one place. The app can be used without signing up, but your notes won't be saved.

Create and editing is easily accessible. Dated notes will appear in the calendar

## :pencil2: Planning and Problem Solving
**Initial planning:**
- [Breakdown of the project](https://sugary-wish-5dd.notion.site/Breaking-down-the-project-dc6c2785df94427e9cfd4afccb449ad1) 
- [Flow diagram](./planning/flow_diagram.pdf)
- [Wireframing](./planning/wireframing.pdf)

## :rocket: Cool features I used
- [Gon Sinatra Gem](https://github.com/gazay/gon-sinatra)
  \
  This was really useful for accessing ruby variables in my javascript file
- [Calendar](https://www.codingnepalweb.com/dynamic-calendar-html-css-javascript/)
  \
  This is the calendar feature I added in my app
- Ruby, Javascript, CSS, HTML
- Sinatra Library

## :warning: Bugs to fix :bug:
- Calendar dots disappear when you change months
- Calendar dots only appear for the current month
- Refactor code!!!

## üòÆ‚Äçüí® Lessons learnt 
- Don't spend too long on a problem if you're stuck. Asking for help earlier on can save you lots of time!

 ## :white_check_mark: Future features
 - Tailwind CSS framework
 - Add notes and list on Calendar page
 - Drag and drop notes
